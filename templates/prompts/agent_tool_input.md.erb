TOOL RESPONSE:

<% tools_response.each do |r| -%>
> <%= r[:agent_name] %>: <%= r[:agent_response] %>
<% end -%>

USER'S INPUT

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond to a single or multiple actions with a json blob of markdown code snippets, and NOTHING else.
