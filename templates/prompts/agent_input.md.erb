TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:

<% agents.values.each do |agent| -%>
> <%= agent.agent_name %>: <%= agent.agent_desc %>
<% end -%>

RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me please, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want humans to use the tools.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
[{
  "action": string \ The action to take. Must be one of <%= agents.values.map do |a| a.agent_name end.join(', ') %>
  "action_input": string \ The input to the action
}]
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": string \ You should put what you want to return to use here <%= Luo::AgentRunnerBase.language_info %>
}
```

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (Remember to respond to a single or multiple actions with a json blob of markdown code snippets, and NOTHING else):

<%= last_user_input %>
