TOOL RESPONSE:

<% @tools_response.each do |r| -%>

USER'S INPUT

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond to a single or multiple actions with a json blob of markdown code snippets, and NOTHING else.
